In this project we have work on the machine predictive maintainance. 
The dataset contains 10000 rows and 10 columns It has 3 columns consist of categorical and 7 categorical data Target Column(Target) is numerical. 
so,I perform classification Machine Learning Algorithm. 
Such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest,svm,knn,navie bayes are applied 
After performing EDA obeserve the change and tried for feature selection RFE method ,and concluded the result using all the process of data analysis
